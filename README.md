# SimplePasswordHasher

```
This project was initially made for password, but it works for every word you want to hash, you will just have to confirm it. 
It is very simple, you just have two fields, one for the password and one to confirm the password. Then, you click the button, 
and if there is no errors, a pop-up will show you the hashed password (and copy it to your clipboard automatically).
After that, you just have to click the OK button on the pop-up and it will close the app.
```

This is not a difficult project, it has only two files, one for the view and one for the functions.
